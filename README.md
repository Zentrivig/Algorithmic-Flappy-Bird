# Algorithmic Flappy Bird
This is an algorithm that plays flappy bird that I programmed for the 2023 ISEF. I was going to also program a backProp and NEAT NN, but because the algorithm works perfectly, I decided to stick with this and call it the best version.
# How to use/install
1. Download the code into any location you want
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the live server extension if you haven't already
4. Host the HTML in a local server

# Change the settings
1. jumpPower = Higher value makes the bird jump higher
2. gForce = Higher value increases gravity
3. birdSpeed = Higher value increases bird flight speed
4. seperation = Horizontal distance between pipes
5. gapSize = Vertical gap in the bars the bird needs to fly through
6. fpsBoost = How many logical frames to run in one graphical frame (higher value increases the speed the game runs at)
7. graphicsActive = Whether or not the bars and bird should render (variables and background is still shown)
